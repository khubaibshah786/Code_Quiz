# Description 



I created a dynamic quiz application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The quiz features a countdown timer, and users can answer a series of questions with multiple choices. The timer stops when either the time runs out or all questions are answered. For each question, the application displays the question title along with a set of choices. After selecting an answer, the application provides immediate feedback by appending a message below the question, indicating whether the chosen answer was correct or incorrect. I also implemented a feature to display the end of the quiz once all questions have been answered. To enhance the user experience, I ensured that the quiz progresses smoothly, updating the content dynamically without reloading the entire page.

## User Story

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## User Acceptance Criteria

Create a code quiz that contains the following requirements:

* A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
 
  * Questions contain buttons for each answer.
  * 
  * When answer is clicked, the next question appears
  * 
  * If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock

* The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.

  * When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score

## Mock-Up
